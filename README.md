# Artalk Plugin Sample

This is a template for creating a new plugin for Artalk.

## Getting Started

To get started with creating your Artalk plugin, follow these steps:

1. **Clone this repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine.
   
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**: Navigate to the cloned directory and install the required dependencies.
   
   ```bash
   cd <cloned_directory>
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Modify the plugin**: You can now start modifying the plugin code to suit your needs. The main files to focus on are `src/main.ts` and any other relevant files within the plugin directory.

    Execute the following command to start the development server.

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

    This will start a development server that watches for changes to your plugin files and automatically reloads the plugin in the browser.

4. **Test your plugin**: It's essential to test your plugin thoroughly to ensure it functions as expected. You can use the provided testing framework or integrate it with your Artalk instance for real-world testing.

5. **Document your plugin**: Update the README.md file to provide clear documentation for your plugin. Include information such as installation instructions, configuration options, usage examples, and any other relevant details.

6. **Build your plugin**: Before publishing your plugin, you may want to build it for production. Use the following command to build your plugin:

   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

7. **Publish your plugin (optional)**: If you're satisfied with your plugin and want to share it with others, consider publishing it to a package registry or the Artalk community. Follow the respective guidelines for publishing plugins.

   ```bash
   pnpm publish
   ```

8. **Contribute**: If you think your plugin could benefit the broader community, consider contributing it to the official Artalk repository or sharing it on relevant platforms.
